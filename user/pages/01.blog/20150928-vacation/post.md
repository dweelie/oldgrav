It appears that once again I've updated the design of this site. I wasn't digging how it looked so I moved some things around, stripped it down a little more, and left it basic and minimal. I'm focused on making this site load quickly. I'm mostly concerned with being functional and neutral. No fancy stuff. No gimmicks.

Basically, I know next to nothing about web design and development. Therefore, this site is a constant work in progress and I can't guarantee proper functionality or reliable service. I'm learning as I go. With that learning comes lots of frustration mixed with scattered eureka moments. It's also loads of fun.

I'm getting hardcore into learning the ins and outs of [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/) and [Git Hub](https://github.com/). Version control is freaking awesome. Before I started developing with Git I would get totally lost as I made changes to code. I manually uploaded everything to my web host through FTP and would easily lose track of my progress. Errors piled up left and right. Git has been a lifesaver.

Not a lot is happening in the wonderful world of music making. I've hit a wall where I don't think working on any more instrumental arrangements will serve the new album. It's time to begin serious work on lyrical and vocal development. Now it's just a matter of getting motivated!

Stacy and I went on vacation last week. We had quite a few fun filled outings!

Look at these two knuckleheads.

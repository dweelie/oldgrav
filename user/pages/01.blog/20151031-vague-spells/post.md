A few weeks ago, out of no where, I came up with the idea to record a 3 song EP. I set forth a few rules:

```
1. This will be a drone album. Each song will center around a single note, chord, or tone with little to no rhythm.

2. Each song will be recorded in one take. No overdubs. No alternate takes. Minimal editing.

3. The songs will be recorded in a red lit room.
```
I didn't want to think too much about this thing, so we went ahead and recorded it quickly and more or less followed the guidelines that were set. I felt stuck from recording the still-untitled 4th album (which I guess, technically, will now be the 5th album) and wanted to complete something, anything, to get the creative juices flowing again.

While listening to the finished tracks, I was kind of surprised. I didn't know what to expect since there wasn't a lot of contemplation beforehand. I had no expectations and therefore could not defeat myself by not meeting them.

I like to think of this album as a sibling to our album [*Etcetera*](https://gravityfreesummer.bandcamp.com/album/etcetera), which was recorded in a similar manner but under different circumstances.

As a songwriter, it is easy to get hung up on song structure, chord progressions, melody, harmony, lyrics, and so on. Recording [*Vague Spells*](https://gravityfreesummer.bandcamp.com/album/vague-spells) allowed the focus to shift towards timbre, tone, and volume. I believe this album is a step forward for our band.
